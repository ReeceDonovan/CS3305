# Installation

## Requirements

Deployment-method agnostic requirements are as follows:

- A Linux server.
- A domain name (e.g. `srec.example.com`).
- A Google OAuth client ID and secret
  - Create a new project on Google Cloud Platform.
  - On the `Credentials` page, select `Create credentials`, then `OAuth client ID`.
  - Select `Web application`, and set a name.
  - Add the URI that is your domain (e.g. `https://srec.example.com`).
  - Add the URI that is your domain with `/api/callback` appended (e.g. `https://srec.example.com/api/callback`).
  - Click `Create`
  - On the page that appears, make a copy the client ID and secret, these will be needed later.

There are two deployment methods for this website:

- [Docker](#docker) <small>\*recommended</small>
- [Manual Deployment](#manual)

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

### Setup

On the linux server, perform the following steps:

- Clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/reecedonovan/cs3305)
  - `git clone https://github.com/reecedonovan/cs3305.git`
- Change directory into the repository
  - `cd cs3305`
- Pull the docker images from Github Container registry
  - `docker-compose pull`
  - (This will take a while, as it has to pull 5 images )
- Copy the template.config.json file to a new file `config.json`
  - `cp template.config.json config.json`
- Edit the `config.json` file to suit your needs, adding the OAuth client
  ID and secret that you created earlier to the `oauth` section.
- Create the `db`, and `data/pdf_store` directories in the current directory.
- Ensure that port 80 is not in use, then run the following command:
  - `docker-compose up -d`

<h2 id="manual">Manual Deployment</h2>

This method is harder to replicate, and may end with a lot of effort to get it to work.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

On the linux server, perform the following steps:

- Clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/reecedonovan/cs3305)
  - `git clone https://github.com/reecedonovan/cs3305.git`
- Get dependencies of each of the components of the website
  - `cd api && yarn && cd ..`
  - `cd ui && yarn && cd ..`
  - `cd docs && yarn && cd ..`
- Deploy a PostgreSQL database
