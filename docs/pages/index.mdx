# Documentation Home

The UCC SREC is one of the three ethical approval committees at UCC. The 
[website](/) is a resource for UCC researchers to make applications to 
have the ethics of their research approved before undertaking it. This 
documentation website aims to instruct users on how to use the website, if 
problems occur. It also hosts the website's [privacy policy](./privacy-policy)
and [license](./license).

The documentation also demonstrates how to maintain and deploy the website 
for coordinators/adminstrators, and how to use and extend the API through 
a RESTful interface (see more [here](./api-reference/reference)).

The website is currently under development. If you have any questions, you 
can add an issue to the 
[github repository](https://github.com/ReeceDonovan/cs3305/issues), or 
send an email to [srec@ucc.ie](mailto:srec@ucc.ie).
