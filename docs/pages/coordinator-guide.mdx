# Guide for Coordinators

When a researcher creates a new application, this application will be added
to your "Coordinator Panel" on the main page. You can see the state of the
application, and whether your input is needed to progress the status of the
application. If an application is in DRAFT mode, you must wait for the
researcher to submit their application to give a preliminary review.

<table style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
  <tr>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DRAFT</td>
    <td>
      The application is in draft mode. You must wait for the researcher to
      submit their application to give a preliminary review.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SUBMITTED</td>
    <td>
      The application has been submitted, and you must approve that the
      application has no obvious issues, before assigning reviewers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>REVIEW</td>
    <td>
      The application is being reviewed by the reviewers you assigned. You can
      see the reviewers who have reviewed the application, and the reviews they
      have given.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PENDING</td>
    <td>
      The application has been reviewed . You can see the reviews and the
      outcome they have given (whether they think the application should be
      accepted or rejected). At this point, you must give feedback to the
      researcher and decide the outcome of the application.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Assigning Reviewers

Once a researcher has submitted an application, a coordinator can assign
reviewers to review the application. This can be done atomatically (back end
system uses a round-robin algorithm to decide which 2 reviewers to assign) or
you can manually select reviewers from a list of all reviewers.

## Giving Feedback

Once an application has been reviewed, the coordinator can give feedback to
the researcher. While giving feedback, you can see the comments left by reviewers
to help give a better understanding of the feedback.
