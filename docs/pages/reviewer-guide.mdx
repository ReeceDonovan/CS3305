# Guide for Reviewers

As a reviewer, it is your task to review applications that get assigned to 
you by the coordinator. You can view applications assigned to you on the 
homepage, under the "Reviewer Panel" table. To begin reviewing, click on 
the application name (in blue) and read the application details and form. 
When you have finished assessing the application, navigate to the "Review" 
tab and leave a comment describing your assessment outcome &rarr; Approved 
or Rejected, and reflect this choice in the dropdown.
