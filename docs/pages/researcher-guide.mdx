# Guide for Researchers

This website aims to ease the process of creating applications to the SREC.
By using this website, the process has been streamlined from the previous 
method, via email. 

To begin the application process, go the the main website, 
and log in <a href="/login" target="_blank">here</a>.

This will create an account for you on the system, ensuring your email 
address is in the correct domain (ucc.ie). After doing this, click on the 
"Create New Application" button to begin the application process.

Provide a name and description of your research topic, and click "Create".

A new application will appear under the "My Applications" table, signifying 
that you successfully created a new draft application. Click on the blue 
title to view and edit your application.

    {/* ![Screenshot of My Application](./image.png) */}
</Bleed>

Under the "View" tab, you can preview information saved about your 
application. Under the "Edit" tab, you can add information about your 
application and upload an application form (the template for which can be 
found [here]("")). Under the "View" tab, edited changes will be reflected
and you can preview the uploaded form. 

Once you are satisfied with the information you have provided, click "Submit"
under the "Edit" tab to submit your application. Note: you cannot edit your 
application after this point. 

After submitting your application, the SREC coordinator performs a pre-review 
to ensure your application is valid and contains all the necessary information, 
before the review process begins. You can see the status of your application 
in the "View" tab.

    <img style={{margin: "auto"}} src="./app_status.png" alt="Screenshot of Application Status"/>
    {/* ![Screenshot of Application Status](./app_status.png) */}
</Bleed>

Once your application has completed the review process, the SREC coordinator 
will determine the outcome of your application, either approving your application
or rejecting it. You can see comments left by the coordinator with instructions
on what to change in your application, if necessary.
