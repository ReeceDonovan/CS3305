# Getting Started with the SREC Website

This project was built with the intent to be generic, to allow other organizations
to use the same codebase to build their own application review websites.
Due to the fact that it is open source (see [the license](../license)
for more info.), you are completely welcome to deploy this website for your
own needs.
